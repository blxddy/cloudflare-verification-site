## So youre probably confused on what this is, right?
This is literally those fake cloudflare verification sites that inject malware, but I made it a working one without stealing your system or anything :D (very cool ik).
Obviously, this is easily bypassable so if you ran this in production youd do checks and stuff so its not so easy to bypass. (if you do run this in prod, credit me if you want :D)

## And you're also wondering where I got this idea from, right?
well I was watching endermans video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLD3haZN-yE (thanks for the idea enderman (if youre reading this)!) and I thought 'hm, what if I take these malware ones and make an actual working one?', which is what I did here, and im glad with what I managed to make (with a bit of help from claude sonnet 4).
I decided to look into this to see if someone had done it already, and I didn't, so I decided to make my own because I was bored and had nothing else to do. I had fun making this so I hope you enjoy it as well :D
